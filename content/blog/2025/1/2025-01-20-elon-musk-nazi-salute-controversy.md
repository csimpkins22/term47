On January 20, 2025, during President Donald Trump's inauguration events, Elon Musk made gestures interpreted by some as Nazi-like salutes, sparking widespread controversy.

While addressing supporters at the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., Musk placed his right hand on his chest and then extended it straight out with his palm facing down—a gesture historically associated with fascist salutes.

Critics condemned the actions, noting that such gestures are offensive and evoke painful historical memories. Supporters argued that Musk's gestures were misinterpreted, suggesting he was expressing heartfelt gratitude to the audience.

The incident has intensified discussions about the influence of tech billionaires in politics and the responsibilities that come with their public platforms.
