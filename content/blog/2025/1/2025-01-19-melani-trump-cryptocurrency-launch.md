First Lady Melania Trump announced the launch of $MELANIA, a cryptocurrency marketed as a digital collectible. Managed through a private entity, the coin quickly achieved a market capitalization of over $8.5 billion. The timing of the launch, just days after President-elect Donald Trump's $TRUMP coin, sparked significant market interest and discussions about potential conflicts of interest.

Critics argue that the First Lady’s financial involvement in the cryptocurrency raises ethical concerns, particularly about the influence of public figures on speculative markets. Questions have also emerged about whether such ventures may impact policy decisions during the administration.

Supporters, on the other hand, view $MELANIA as an innovative way to engage with the public and promote digital collectibles.

## Key Points:

- **Market Impact:** $MELANIA’s market capitalization surged past $8.5 billion shortly after its launch.
- **Ethical Concerns:** Critics cite potential conflicts of interest and the First Lady's financial involvement in a speculative market.
- **Public Engagement:** The coin is positioned as a digital collectible aimed at connecting with supporters in a novel way.
