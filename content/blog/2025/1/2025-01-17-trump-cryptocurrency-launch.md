President-elect Donald Trump announced the launch of $Trump, a cryptocurrency managed through his company, CIC Digital LLC, which retained 80% of the coin's supply. Within two days of its introduction, the coin’s valuation soared, raising significant concerns among ethics experts and watchdogs.

Critics argue that this move may violate the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, as it opens the door for foreign entities to purchase the cryptocurrency and indirectly benefit the President financially.

Supporters of the cryptocurrency argue it represents innovation and a new way to engage with supporters, but questions remain about transparency and accountability.

## Ethical Implications

The launch of $Trump highlights potential conflicts of interest, as Trump’s financial stake in the cryptocurrency could directly influence policy decisions. The move has sparked bipartisan scrutiny, with lawmakers questioning the propriety of a sitting President engaging in such ventures.

### Key Points:
- **80% Ownership**: CIC Digital LLC owns the majority of $Trump coins.
- **Market Impact**: The coin’s valuation skyrocketed shortly after launch.
- **Ethics Concerns**: Critics cite potential emoluments clause violations.
